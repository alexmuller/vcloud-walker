# VCloud Walker

We used thor to build a command line tool.

to get list of commands: `bundle exec thor list`

then you can issue a command such as walk. 

   `bundle exec thor walk:vdcs <ORG-ID>`

`bundle exec thor walk:catalogs <ORG-ID>`

`bundle exec thor walk:networks <ORG-ID>`

you will also need your user details in your environment:

    API_USERNAME
    API_PASSWORD
